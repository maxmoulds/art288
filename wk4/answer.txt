All my files will be web based (github). I will also have local 'trash' copies on my machines along with a periodic 'archive' backup done at 00:00.
As far as keeping files up-to-date github provides versioning. So anytime I feel I need to save I'll push local to github, and if the design gets too messy I'll be able to pull the current head of the project or any previous commit. 
Regular backups are scheduled (cron) and also part of the SLA from github (more or less).
