Choosing the Right Resolution 
Monitor resolution (ppi), image resolution (ppi) and print resolution (screen frequency or lpi-lines per inch) 

Web = 72ppi
Printing to an inexpensive inkjet = 150-220ppi.
Professional Printing = 300ppi-600ppi

Scan at a resolution 1.5 to 2.0 the screen frequency (lpi). Check with your printer for output resolutions. Example: If the printer says the output is 150 lpi, scan at a minimum of 300ppi.
